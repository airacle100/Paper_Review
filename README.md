  Paper reviews on AI robotics (i.e. deep learning, computer vision, robot perception, navigation and control etc.)
</p>

## ðŸŒŸ Project Goal
The goal is to review one or two papers per week, beginning from fundamental deep learning and progressing toward robotics-related research.

- Robot Perception
  - 6D pose estimation
  - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
    - Visual SLAM (vSLAM)
 
- Robot Control
  - autonomous flight
  - aerial manipulation
  - multi-(aerial) robot system
